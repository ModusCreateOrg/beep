Verify the integrity of your existing credentials or just before creating new accounts.

BEEP checks your account information against databases of leaked credentials in known data breaches.

With BEEP you test one thing at a time. Independently check if your password is safe or if your username/email are compromised. 

BEEP never transmits your passwords. Passwords are encoded with the SHA-1 algorithm on your device and only the first 5 characters of that hash are sent to the verification engine.
